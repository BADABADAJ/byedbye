            <p> There are many types of eating disorders. Some common ones include Anorexia nervosa, Pica, Rumination disorder, Bulemia nervosa, Binge eating disorder, and Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder(ARFID).
                <br>
                <br>While each type involves an extreme focus on food, their symptoms vary. Eating disorders are a group of related conditions involving extreme food and weight issues, but each disorder has unique symptoms and diagnosis criteria. Here are six of the most common eating disorders and their symptoms.

            <p><a href=https://www.healthline.com/health/anorexia-nervosa>Anorexia nervosa</a> primarily affects adolescent and young adult women, who perceive themselves as overweight despite being underweight. This leads to obsessive weight monitoring, food avoidance, and severe <a href=https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/calorie-restriction-risks>calorie restriction</a>.
               Common symptoms of anorexia nervosa include:</p>
               <br>
               <ul class="styled-list-6">
               <li>intense fear of gaining weight or persistent behaviors to avoid gaining weight
                <br>, despite being underweight</li>
               <li>a heavy influence of body weight or perceived body shape on self-esteem</li>
               <li>a distorted body image, including denial of being seriously underweight</li>

        <div class="paragraph-6">
            <p> However, it’s important to note that weight should not be the major focus of diagnosing someone with anorexia. Using body mass index as a factor in diagnosis is outdated because people who are categorized as “normal” or “overweight” can have the same risks. In atypical anorexia, for example, a person may meet the criteria for anorexia but not be underweight despite significant weight loss<a href=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/anorexia-nervosa>(7).</p>
                <br>
                <p><a href=https://www.healthline.com/health/ocd/social-signs>Obsessive-compulsive symptoms</a> are also often present. For instance, many people with anorexia are preoccupied with constant thoughts about food, and some may obsessively collect recipes or hoard food. They may also have difficulty eating in public and exhibit a strong desire to control their environment, limiting their ability to be spontaneous <a href=https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Eating-Disorders>(3)</a>.

            <p> Anorexia is officially categorized into two subtypes — the restricting type and the binge eating and purging type. Individuals with the restricting type lose weight solely through dieting, fasting, or excessive exercise. Individuals with the binge eating and purging type may binge on large amounts of food or eat very little. In both cases, after they eat, they purge using activities such as vomiting, taking laxatives or diuretics, or exercising excessively. Anorexia can be very damaging to the body. Over time, individuals living with it may experience thinning of their bones, infertility, and brittle hair and nails. In severe cases, anorexia can result in heart, brain, or multi-organ failure and death.

            <p> <a href=https://www.healthline.com/health/pica>Pica</a> is an eating disorder that involves eating things that are not considered food and that do not provide nutritional value.
                Individuals with pica crave non-food substances such as ice, dirt, soil, chalk, soap, paper, hair, cloth, wool, pebbles, laundry detergent, or cornstarch <a href=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders>(11)</a>.
                Pica can occur in adults, children, and adolescents.
                It is most frequently seen in individuals with conditions that affect daily functioning, including intellectual disabilities, developmental conditions such as <a href=https://www.healthline.com/health/autism>autism spectrum disorder</a>, and mental health conditions such as <a href= https://www.healthline.com/health/schizophrenia>schizophrenia</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Individuals with pica face risks like poisoning, infections, and <a href= https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-common-nutrient-deficiencies>nutritional deficiencies</a>. In severe cases, it can be fatal. However, for it to be diagnosed as pica, eating non-food substances must not be culturally or religiously sanctioned, nor socially accepted by peers.

        <div class="paragraph-6">
            <p><a href= https://www.healthline.com/health/rumination-disorder>Rumination disorder</a> is another newly recognized eating disorder.
                It describes a condition in which a person regurgitates food they have previously chewed and swallowed, re-chews it, and then either re-swallows it or spits it out <a href=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/other/rumination-disorder>(15)</a>.
                This rumination typically occurs within the first 30 minutes after a meal <a href=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7594/rumination-disorder>(16)</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This disorder can develop during infancy, childhood, or adulthood. In infants, it tends to develop between 3 and 12 months of age and often disappears on its own. Children and adults with the condition usually require therapy to resolve it.
                If not resolved in infants, rumination disorder can result in weight loss and severe malnutrition that can be fatal.
                Adults with this disorder may restrict the amount of food they eat, especially in public. This may lead them to lose weight and become underweight

            <p> <a href=https://www.healthline.com/health/bulimia-nervosa>Bulimia nervosa</a>, like anorexia, typically arises in adolescence or early adulthood and is less common among men. Those affected binge eat, lose control, and then purge through vomiting, fasting, or excessive exercise. Unlike anorexia, they usually maintain a normal weight<a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26754944>(10)</a>.
                Common symptoms of bulimia nervosa include:</p>

               Common symptoms of ARFID include <a href= https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders>(11)</a>:</p>

            <p>One disorder that may currently fall under OSFED is orthorexia.

                <br>
                <p>Individuals with orthorexia tend to have an obsessive focus on healthy eating to an extent that disrupts their daily lives. They may compulsively check ingredient lists and nutritional labels and obsessively follow “healthy lifestyle” accounts on social media.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Someone with this condition may eliminate entire food groups, fearing that they’re unhealthy. This can lead to malnutrition, severe weight loss, difficulty eating outside the home, and emotional distress. Individuals with orthorexia are rarely focused on losing weight. Instead, their self-worth, identity, or satisfaction is dependent on how well they comply with their self-imposed diet rules <a href= https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/orthorexia>(19)</a>.
