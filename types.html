            <p> There are many types of eating disorders. Some common ones include anorexia nervosa, binge eating disorder, bulemia nervosa, Rumination disorder, and pica. While each type involves an extreme focus on food, their symptoms vary. Eating disorders are a group of related conditions involving extreme food and weight issues, but each disorder has unique symptoms and diagnosis criteria. Here are six of the most common eating disorders and their symptoms.

        <div class="paragraph-6">
            <p>Anorexia nervosa is likely the most well-known eating disorder.
                It generally develops during adolescence or young adulthood and tends to affect more women than men (10Trusted Source).
                People with anorexia generally view themselves as overweight, even if they’re dangerously underweight. They tend to constantly monitor their weight, avoid eating certain types of foods, and severely restrict their calorie intake.
                Common symptoms of anorexia nervosa include (1):</p>
                <ul class="styled-list-6">
                <li>very restricted eating patterns</li>
                <li>intense fear of gaining weight or persistent behaviors to avoid gaining weight, despite being underweight</li>
                <li>a relentless pursuit of thinness and unwillingness to maintain a healthy weight</li>
                <li>a heavy influence of body weight or perceived body shape on self-esteem</li>
                <li>a distorted body image, including denial of being seriously underweight</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
                <p>However, it’s important to note that weight should not be the major focus of diagnosing someone with anorexia.
                Using body mass index as a factor in diagnosis is outdated because people who are categorized as “normal” or “overweight” can have the same risks.
                In atypical anorexia, for example, a person may meet the criteria for anorexia but not be underweight despite significant weight loss (7).
                Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are also often present. For instance, many people with anorexia are preoccupied with constant thoughts about food, and some may obsessively collect recipes or hoard food.
                They may also have difficulty eating in public and exhibit a strong desire to control their environment, limiting their ability to be spontaneous (3).
                Anorexia is officially categorized into two subtypes — the restricting type and the binge eating and purging type (1).
                Individuals with the restricting type lose weight solely through dieting, fasting, or excessive exercise.
                Individuals with the binge eating and purging type may binge on large amounts of food or eat very little. In both cases, after they eat, they purge using activities such as vomiting, taking laxatives or diuretics, or exercising excessively.
                Anorexia can be very damaging to the body. Over time, individuals living with it may experience thinning of their bones, infertility, and brittle hair and nails.
                In severe cases, anorexia can result in heart, brain, or multi-organ failure and death.

    <div class="container-6">
        <div class="paragraph-6">
            <p> Pica is an eating disorder that involves eating things that are not considered food and that do not provide nutritional value (14).
                Individuals with pica crave non-food substances such as ice, dirt, soil, chalk, soap, paper, hair, cloth, wool, pebbles, laundry detergent, or cornstarch (11Trusted Source).
                Pica can occur in adults, children, and adolescents.
                It is most frequently seen in individuals with conditions that affect daily functioning, including intellectual disabilities, developmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, and mental health conditions such as schizophrenia (14).
                Individuals with pica may be at an increased risk of poisoning, infections, gut injuries, and nutritional deficiencies. Depending on the substances ingested, pica may be fatal.
                However, for the condition to be considered pica, the eating of non-food substances must not be a typical part of someone’s culture or religion. In addition, it must not be considered a socially acceptable practice by a person’s peers.

        <div class="paragraph-6">
            <p>Rumination disorder is another newly recognized eating disorder.
                It describes a condition in which a person regurgitates food they have previously chewed and swallowed, re-chews it, and then either re-swallows it or spits it out (15).
                This rumination typically occurs within the first 30 minutes after a meal (16).
                This disorder can develop during infancy, childhood, or adulthood. In infants, it tends to develop between 3 and 12 months of age and often disappears on its own. Children and adults with the condition usually require therapy to resolve it.
                If not resolved in infants, rumination disorder can result in weight loss and severe malnutrition that can be fatal.
                Adults with this disorder may restrict the amount of food they eat, especially in public. This may lead them to lose weight and become underweight

    <div class="container-6">
        <div class="paragraph-6">
            <p>Bulimia nervosa is another well-known eating disorder.
                Like anorexia, bulimia tends to develop during adolescence and early adulthood and appears to be less common among men than women (10Trusted Source).
                People with bulimia frequently eat unusually large amounts of food in a specific period of time.
                Each binge eating episode usually continues until the person becomes painfully full. During a binge, the person usually feels that they cannot stop eating or control how much they are eating.
                Binges can happen with any type of food but most commonly occur with foods the individual would usually avoid.
                Individuals with bulimia then attempt to purge to compensate for the calories consumed and to relieve gut discomfort.
                Common purging behaviors include forced vomiting, fasting, laxatives, diuretics, enemas, and excessive exercise.
                Symptoms may appear very similar to those of the binge eating or purging subtypes of anorexia nervosa. However, individuals with bulimia usually maintain a relatively typical weight rather than losing a large amount of weight.
                Common symptoms of bulimia nervosa include (1):</p>
                <ul class="styled-list-6">
                    <li>recurrent episodes of binge eating with a feeling of lack of control</li>
                    <li>recurrent episodes of inappropriate purging behaviors to prevent weight gain</li>
                    <li>elf-esteem overly influenced by body shape and weight</li>
                    <li>a fear of gaining weight, despite having a typical weight</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
                <p>Side effects of bulimia may include an inflamed and sore throat, swollen salivary glands, worn tooth enamel, tooth decay, acid reflux, irritation of the gut, severe dehydration, and hormonal disturbances (11Trusted Source).
                In severe cases, bulimia can also create an imbalance in levels of electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and calcium. This can cause a stroke or heart attack.

            <p>Binge eating disorder is the most prevalent form of eating disorder and one of the most common chronic illnesses among adolescents (12Trusted Source).
                It typically begins during adolescence and early adulthood, although it can develop later on.
                Individuals with this disorder have symptoms similar to those of bulimia or the binge eating subtype of anorexia.
                For instance, they typically eat unusually large amounts of food in relatively short periods of time and feel a lack of control during binges.
                People with binge eating disorder do not restrict calories or use purging behaviors, such as vomiting or excessive exercise, to compensate for their binges (12Trusted Source).
                Common symptoms of binge eating disorder include (11Trusted Source):</p>
                <ul class="styled-list-6">
                <li>eating large amounts of food rapidly, in secret, and until uncomfortably full, despite not feeling hungry</li>
                <li>feeling a lack of control during episodes of binge eating</li>
                <li>feelings of distress, such as shame, disgust, or guilt, when thinking about the binge eating behavior</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
                <p>People with binge eating disorder often consume an excessive amount of food and may not make nutritious food choices. This may increase their risk of medical complications such as heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes (13Trusted Source).

            <p>Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a new name for an old disorder.
                The term has replaced the term “feeding disorder of infancy and early childhood,” a diagnosis previously reserved for children under age 7 (17).
                Individuals with this disorder experience disturbed eating due to either a lack of interest in eating or a distaste for certain smells, tastes, colors, textures, or temperatures.
                Common symptoms of ARFID include (11Trusted Source):</p>
                <ul class="styled-list-6">
                <li>avoidance or restriction of food intake that prevents the person from eating enough calories or nutrients</li>
                <li>eating habits that interfere with typical social functions, such as eating with others</li>
                <li>weight loss or poor development for age and height</li>
                <li>nutrient deficiencies or dependence on supplements or tube feeding</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
                <p>It’s important to note that ARFID goes beyond common behaviors such as picky eating in toddlers or lower food intake in older adults.
                Moreover, it does not include the avoidance or restriction of foods due to lack of availability or religious or cultural practices.

            <p>In addition to the six eating disorders above, other less known or less common eating disorders also exist.
                These include (18):
                </p>
                <ul class="styled-list-6">
                <li>Purging disorder. Individuals with purging disorder often use purging behaviors, such as vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, or excessive exercising, to control their weight or shape. However, they do not binge.</li>
                <li>Night eating syndrome. Individuals with this syndrome frequently eat excessively at night, often after awakening from sleep. </li>
                <li>Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED). While it is not found in the DSM-5, this category includes any other conditions that have symptoms similar to those of an eating disorder but don’t fit any of the disorders above.</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
                <p>One disorder that may currently fall under OSFED is orthorexia. Although orthorexia is increasingly mentioned in the media and in scientific studies, the DSM does not yet recognize it as a separate eating disorder (19).
                    Individuals with orthorexia tend to have an obsessive focus on healthy eating to an extent that disrupts their daily lives. They may compulsively check ingredient lists and nutritional labels and obsessively follow “healthy lifestyle” accounts on social media.
                    Someone with this condition may eliminate entire food groups, fearing that they’re unhealthy. This can lead to malnutrition, severe weight loss, difficulty eating outside the home, and emotional distress.
                    Individuals with orthorexia are rarely focused on losing weight. Instead, their self-worth, identity, or satisfaction is dependent on how well they comply with their self-imposed diet rules (19).
