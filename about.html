    <p>Experts believe that a variety of factors may contribute to eating disorders. One of these is genetics. People who have a sibling or parent with an eating disorder seem to be at an increased risk of developing one (3). Personality traits are another factor. In particular, neuroticism, perfectionism, and impulsivity are three personality traits often linked to a higher risk of developing an eating disorder, according to a 2015 research review (8Trusted Source).</p>   
    <p>Other potential causes include perceived pressures to be thin, cultural preferences for thinness, and exposure to media promoting these ideals (8Trusted Source).
        More recently, experts have proposed that differences in brain structure and biology may also play a role in the development of eating disorders. In particular, levels of the brain messaging chemicals serotonin and dopamine may be factors (9).
        However, more studies are needed before strong conclusions can be made.</p>
