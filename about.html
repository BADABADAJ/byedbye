    <p>In modern society, countless people suffer from eating disorders. Although we tend to let go of the eating disorder as a light one, this can disastrously quietly ruin our daily lives or life in the long run. Also, not only can it have a significant physical impact, but it is also spiritually intimately linked. An appetite is one of humans' three basic needs: sleep and libido. Everyone has a different relationship with food. For something, it is a source of comfort, indulgence, or persistence. When these relationships are broken, food is no longer a pleasure but a sense of pain, guilt, and burden, just like endless tasks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are various types of eating disorders, but new categories are constantly being discovered and researched. Eating disorders are common health problems that occur in more than 5 percent of people worldwide, which can come at any moment in our lives. However, they are usually found in adolescence or young adulthood. The causes of eating disorders are a complex interaction of biological, psychological, behavioral, genetic, and social factors. However, this is one of the reasons for the tremendous pressure and stress of meeting the standards of a society that seeks perfection for women's beauty. In particular, women have higher rates of Anorexia nervosa, Bulemia nervosa, and Binge Eating Disorder than men.</p>
