    <p><h1>What causes eating disorders?</h1>
        <br>

        <P>Experts believe that a variety of factors may contribute to eating disorders. One of these is genetics. People who have a sibling or parent with an eating disorder seem to be at an increased risk of developing one <a href=https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Eating-Disorders>(3)</a>. Personality traits are another factor. In particular, neuroticism, <a href=https://www.healthline.com/health/perfectionism>perfectionism</a>, and <a href=https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/impulsive-behavior>impulsivity</a> are three personality traits often linked to a higher risk of developing an eating disorder, according to a 2015 research review <a href= https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26095891>(8)</a>.
            Other potential causes include perceived pressures to be thin, cultural preferences for thinness, and exposure to media promoting these ideals <a href= https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26095891>(8)</a>.
            More recently, experts have proposed that differences in brain structure and biology may also play a role in the development of eating disorders. In particular, levels of the brain messaging chemicals <a href= https://www.healthline.com/health/dopamine-vs-serotonin>serotonin and dopamine</a> may be factors <a href= https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00600/full>(9)</a>.
            However, more studies are needed before strong conclusions can be made.</P>

        <h1>How do you know?</h1>
        <br>

        <P>If you have an eating disorder, identifying the condition and seeking treatment sooner will improve your chances of recovering. Being aware of the warning signs and symptoms can help you decide whether you need to seek help.
            Not everyone will have every sign or symptom at once, but certain behaviors may signal a problem, such as <a href= https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/warning-signs-and-symptoms>(20)</a>:
            <br>
            <br>•behaviors and attitudes that indicate that weight loss, dieting, and control over food are becoming primary concerns
            <br>•preoccupation with weight, food, calories, fats, grams, and dieting
            <br>•refusal to eat certain foods
            <br>•discomfort with eating around others
            <br>•skipping meals or eating only small portions
            <br>•frequent dieting or fad diets
            <br>•extreme concern with body size, shape, and appearance
            <br>•frequently checking in the mirror for perceived flaws in appearance
            <br>•extreme mood swings
            <br>
            <br>If these symptoms resonate with you and you think you may have an eating disorder, it’s important to reach out to a medical professional for help.
            <br>Making the decision to start eating disorder recovery might feel scary or overwhelming, but seeking help from medical professionals, eating disorder recovery support groups, and your community can make recovery easier.
